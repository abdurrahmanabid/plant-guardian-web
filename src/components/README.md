# Components Structure

## AnimatedForm Refactoring

The large `AnimatedForm.jsx` file has been refactored into smaller, more manageable components:

### Main Components

1. **AnimatedForm.jsx** (157 lines)
   - Main container component
   - Handles animations and state management
   - Orchestrates other components

2. **FormSidebar.jsx** (50 lines)
   - Left sidebar with field list
   - Displays all form fields
   - Handles field selection

3. **FieldDetailsPanel.jsx** (125 lines)
   - Right panel showing field details
   - Field preview and properties
   - Submit button

4. **FieldItem.jsx** (54 lines)
   - Individual field item in sidebar
   - Shows field status (filled, error, selected)

### Hooks and Utilities

5. **useFormValidation.js** (80 lines)
   - Custom hook for form validation
   - Handles form data, errors, and validation logic

6. **SoilAnalysisFields.js** (133 lines)
   - Hook that provides soil analysis field data
   - Centralized field configuration

### Benefits of Refactoring

- **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the app
- **Testability**: Smaller components are easier to test
- **Readability**: Code is more organized and easier to understand
- **Performance**: Better code splitting and lazy loading potential

### Usage

```jsx
import { AnimatedForm } from './components';

// Use the main component
<AnimatedForm />
```

### File Sizes Before vs After

  - FormSidebar.jsx: 50 lines
  - FieldDetailsPanel.jsx: 125 lines
  - FieldItem.jsx: 54 lines
  - useFormValidation.js: 80 lines
  - SoilAnalysisFields.js: 133 lines
